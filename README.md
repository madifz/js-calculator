[ ] Store the first number that is input into the calculator when a user presses an operator, and also save which operation has been chosen and then operate() on them when the user presses the “=” key
[ ] Figure out how to store all the values and call the operate function with them
[ ] Users should be able to string together several operations and get the right answer, with each pair of numbers being evaluated at a time
